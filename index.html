          Welcome! This is my first-ever website, a
          <span class="red">resume</span>, and let's be honest, it's pretty
          rough. Consider it a rookie attempt at web development. Expect wonky
          layouts and questionable design choices, "we all start somewhere",
          they say. We did this as an activity for our 1st sem back in 2nd Year.

          The next project I created was my portfolio website, essentially an
          upgraded rendition of the resume assignment.. We did this as out final
          output at the end of the 1st semester of 2nd year after learning other
          stuffs about HTML and CSS.

          The subsequent project I developed was It's so K!, an e-commerce
          platform specializing in K-pop merchandise. Crafting this endeavor was
          particularly fulfilling as I fused my personal interests into the
          creation process. Additionally, this is my first experience with
          React.js, presenting a challenging yet worthy experience.

          I'm thrilled to present our mini thesis project â€“ a Library Management
          System developed collaboratively for our school. This marks my first
          venture into teamwork and web development. With React.js, Tailwind
          CSS, and Supabase, we've crafted a system we're proud of. Huge thanks
          to my supportive group members who pushed me beyond my limits,
          ensuring I never felt left behind. This project stands as a testament
          to our collective effort and determination.
